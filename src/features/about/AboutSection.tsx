        In late 2019, feeling adrift, I stumbled upon my passion for Software
        engineering, thanks to a former university colleague. Embracing the dawn
        of 2020 with a <strong>newfound challenge</strong>, I set out on a
        mission to master this thing called "web development". Since that
        moment, every day has been a quest for knowledge and growth, fueled by a
        steadfast dedication for improvement.

        Meticulous and detail-oriented, I take pride in crafting solutions that
        emit both external elegance and internal integrity. Organized and
        driven, I thrive on <strong>continuous learning</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>self-improvement</strong>, setting{' '}
        <strong>high standards</strong> for myself in every endeavor I take on.
      </p>

        Beyond the screen, I adore running (sports, in general) and spending
        quality time with friends and family, embracing a{' '}
        <strong>balanced</strong> and <strong>fruitful</strong> life.
